# ATM-Simulator-SE-Project

Proposed Project Description: ATM Simulator

The ATM Simulator is a user-friendly web application that replicates the functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It allows users to conveniently carry out banking transactions without physically visiting a bank branch. The system encompasses various essential features, including account statements, withdrawal and depositing of funds, and changing the PIN.

The key functionalities available in the ATM Simulator include:

1. User Login / Authentication: Users can securely log in to the system using their credentials.

2. Account Statement: Users can view their account statements, which provide details of their transactions.

3. Withdrawing Amount: Users can initiate cash withdrawals from their accounts.

4. Depositing Amount: Users can deposit funds into their accounts through the simulator.

5. Changing the PIN: Users have the ability to change their PIN for enhanced security.

6. Account Balance: Users can check their account balance to monitor their funds.

7. Change Phone Number: Users can update their registered phone number associated with their account.

8. Block the ATM Card: In case of loss or theft, users can block their ATM card to prevent unauthorized usage.

9. And more: The ATM Simulator offers additional functionalities to enhance the banking experience.

The ATM Simulator web application provides a user-friendly interface, making it effortless for users to navigate and utilize its features. It aims to replicate the convenience and accessibility offered by physical ATMs while providing a secure and efficient virtual banking experience.
